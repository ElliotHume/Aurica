The ceiling for growth in Aurica is limited only by your dedication.

#### Foreword:
This game is not intended for mass-market or publishing. This game is a testing grounds for developing the Aurica System, which is the game system for spell casting. The game has progressed through multiple prototypes due to the creators desire to play the game with others and share the game system in an way that players can get engaged in.
The Aurica System is inherently unbalanced, but there is ongoing work to balance different factors of unfairness so that every player has an avenue of progress and gameplay that is competitively valid, you can read more on this in the wiki of the Aurica System.

Due to this prototyping process the code is not very well architectured, I am very aware of this. If the game shows promise once I open it up to more players I will go through with a mass architecture refactoring.

### Description
Players face each other in multiplayer battles of skilled spell casting. The objective of each match is to reduce your opponent(s) shared pool of lives to zero before they do the same to you. To do this well the player must learn the strengths of their own pseudo-randomly generated Aura. A player's Aura is a distribution of mana types that interact with spell casting to make spells stronger or weaker depending on how the mana in the spell is balanced.

There are a wealth of spell options to choose from in each battle. Currently there are over 60 unique spells implemented and more being developed constantly. Part of the balance of the game is this large selection of spells, you can read more about this in the wiki.


### How to play
To get started, download the most recent pre-release build from the releases tab here in GitHub.

Once you have downloaded the game, you will be prompted to register an account. After you have created an account with a username and email you will be presented with the option to take the Aura questionnaire, which will influence how your Aura is rolled. You can also choose to skip this step and roll a completely random Aura.

Once you are logged in and have gone through the Aura generation, you will be moved onto the main menu. To get started, hit the "Free Play" button, which will put you in a  lobby where you can get a feel for the controls and choose a spell loadout to play with. There is a basic tutorial if you go through the gateway that is in front (and slightly to the right) of where you spawned in.

If you want to face a friend in a match, return to the main menu and type in an agreed upon room name and hit the "Join Room" button. This will put you in the default battlegrounds, but you can change this by including a specific substring in the room name that (sorry for the awful UX there, I'm working on it). You can select the arena using the button beside the "Join Room" button. The default arena is a free for all mode with an objective ball in the middle (that you take and dunk at the spawnpoints), but there are also team deathmatch arenas available.
